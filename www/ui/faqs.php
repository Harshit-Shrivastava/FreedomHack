        						 i) Reduce the Carbon Footprint of Your Travel
Combine your trip with another.  
Carpool - Just once a week saves 20%.
Check out your transit options - It may not work for you every time, but use it when it does.
What about your bike? - Get in shape, too!  
Only a mile? - Walk.
Think it through - Do you need to take this trip at all?  
Get it on the Internet.  
Optimize - Save this trip for later and combine with another.  
Telecommute - Work from home occasionally.

ii) Reduce the Carbon Footprint of Your Air Travel
Think about the trip - Can you combine it with another or get more done on one trip?  
Train - For some trips the train may be a good choice for you.
Fly nonstop - Nonstop flights are better than connecting flights (for many reasons).  
When you get there - Do some research ahead of time to find better ground travel options (shuttles, transit, trains, etc.) at your destination.  
Lodging - Ask your hotel about their environmental commitment and steps they’re taking to reduce, offset.
While you’re away - Turn your stuff off.  Turn down your thermostat and your water heater; turn off your electronics (even smarter: unplug them to protect from electrical storms).  What’s the point of things being on with no one there?

iii) Reduce the Carbon Footprint of Your Car
Drive better - Studies have shown up to 30% of the difference in miles per gallon (MPG) is due to driving habits alone.  You could save more than a ton of CO2 per year by:
  - Accelerating slowly and smoothly
  - Driving the speed limit
  - Maintaining a steady speed
  - Anticipating your stops and starts
Maintenance - Keep your car tuned up and running efficiently.  
More Maintenance - Replace your air, oil and fuel filters according to schedule.  
Tires - Keep your tires properly inflated (just this can save 400-700 pounds of CO2 per year).  
Make your next vehicle a fuel-efficient one - Check out EPA’s Green Vehicle Guide for info on miles per gallon as well as EPA SmartWay® certified vehicles, meeting rigorous air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions standards.
Household fuel efficiency - If your household has two cars and one is used mostly for commuting, make the commuting car a real gas sipper if you can’t for both.
